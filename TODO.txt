Cassandra library:
- This is starting to be too slow:
  - Build a console test using Game so we can start profiling
  - Use lightweight State Diffs as clones
- Limit the depth of scanning, so the goal is only found when you are _close_ to it. This saves memory too, of course.
- Process first nodes in the incomplete list closer to the Player -> Does the algorithm still hold?
  We have assumed that unprocessed nodes are always further away.
- Do not show GOAL at all?
- Only show one ghost at a time so it is less confusing?
- Fix overlapping ghosts.
- Do we need the Action class? we are never undoing them now that we do not recurse.
- Having both the TileType and the double-dispatcher is ugly...

Cassandra test 1: Discrete in time and space, position is matrix-based, time is controlled by player
- Render blocks only when in LOS (or render darker)
- Wolf: Moves and goes for Cass if it sees her
- Archer: Kills Cass if it sees her

Cassanda test 2: Discrete in time and space, position is matrix-based, time is independent of player
- Timed blocks
- Wolf and Archer advance on their own.

Cassandra test 3: Continuous in time and space, matrix map but free-running player and objects (positions not limited to matrix)
- Rolling balls
- Free-running Cass
