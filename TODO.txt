Cassandra library:
- OPTIMIZATIONS:
  - Keeping as whole copy of game state in each node can be expensive.
    - Keep only the Actions in the transitions and build the game state as the exploration progresses. OR
    - Store a const pointer to original state and a "diff", which will be mostly NULL.

Cassandra test 1: Discrete in time and space, position is matrix-based, time is controlled by player
- Render blocks only when in LOS (or render darker)
- Wolf: Moves and goes for Cass if it sees her
- Archer: Kills Cass if it sees her

Cassanda test 2: Discrete in time and space, position is matrix-based, time is independent of player
- Timed blocks
- Wolf and Archer advance on their own.

Cassandra test 3: Continuous in time and space, matrix map but free-running player and objects (positions not limited to matrix)
- Rolling balls
- Free-running Cass
