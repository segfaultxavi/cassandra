Cassandra test 1 (Matrix-based, time controlled by player)
* Pit
* PUshable block
* Triggers & doors
* Transparent ghostplane
- Render blocks only when in LOS (or render darker)
- Wolf
* Roguelike tiles
- Allow backtracking to reduce probability of paths that lead to death or merge with higher-probability paths.
- Cumulative analysis: recursion depth increases frame after frame, if player has not moved -> standing still refines view

Cassanda test 2 (Matrix-based, time independent of player)
- Timed blocks

Cassandra test 3 (Matrix map, free-running player and objects)
- Mobs (intelligent, rolling balls)
- Free-running Cass
